title: Implementing Client-to-Client File Transfers
draft: "true"
---
Merry Christmas 🎄🎁! It has been a hot minute since we [[3.5. An Underwhelming Day|last]] worked on the project, where we restructured the whole project for future-proofing. Today I plan on tackling connecting multiple clients and sharing files between them. But why?
## Why? 🤔
![[Client-server-current]]
This is a pretty good representation of how our app works right now. We can definitely connect multiple clients to the same server. But all of our communications are one-way, i.e. the client can send files to the server, but not the other way around. If you think about it, this is a pretty crappy file sharing app in all aspects.

Either we could have the server just store files, which we can do now, but what good is storing files if you can't access them when you need them? Another way we could go from here is to have the server act as a bridge between two clients, but right now, the bridge only goes one way. So either way the situation right now is not ideal. 

We are going with the latter, having the server act as a bridge between two clients sharing files with each other. ![[client-server-future]]
So where do we start?
## Tracking all the connected clients 📋
We can use an `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, TcpStream>>>` to keep track of all the usernames and their respective sockets. 
`/glide-server/src/main.rs 10:0`
```rust
type SharedState = Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>>;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
	let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
	println!("Server is running on 127.0.0.1:8080");
	
	// Shared state for tracking connected clients
	let state: SharedState = Arc::new(Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));
	
	loop {
		let (mut socket, addr) = listener.accept().await?;
		let state = Arc::clone(&state); // Clone the state for each connection
		
		println!("New connection from: {}", addr);
		tokio::spawn(async move {
			if let Err(e) = handle_client(&mut socket, state).await {
				eprintln!("Error handling client {}: {}", addr, e);
			}
		});
	}
}
```

Next we can modify `handle_client` to register the user
`glide-server/src/main.rs 34:0`
```rust
async fn handle_client(
	socket: &mut TcpStream,
	state: SharedState,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
	let mut buffer = vec![0; CHUNK_SIZE];
	
	// Step 1: Register the client with a username
	let bytes_read = socket.read(&mut buffer).await?;
	if bytes_read == 0 {
		return Ok(()); // Client disconnected
	}
	
	// Extract the username
	let username = 
		String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer[..bytes_read]).trim().to_string();
	{
		let mut clients = state.lock().await;
		if clients.contains_key(&username) {
			socket.write_all(b"Username already taken").await?;
			return Err("Username conflict".into());
		}
		clients.insert(username.clone(), socket.peer_addr()?.to_string());
	}
	
	println!("Client '{}' connected", username);
	socket.write_all(b"Welcome to the server!\n").await?;

	// Snip Snip
}
```

Let's also implement a function to remove a client:
`glide-server/src/main.rs`
```rust
async fn remove_client(username: &str, state: &SharedState) {
	let mut clients = state.lock().await;
	clients.remove(username);
	println!("Client '{}' disconnected", username);
}
```
