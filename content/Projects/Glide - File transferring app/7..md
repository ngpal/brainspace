Hellooooo! We're back, and today I want to reorganize and refactor some of the methods, especially on the server side. All the changes we made in the [[6. Ready to Glide!|last log]] was a bit messy ðŸ˜¬. So let's dive in!
## Refactoring
Right now, all our function are scattered around, some in `struct Command`, and others like `handle_command`, `cmd_list`, `cmd_reqs` etc. are just floating around. We could refactor all this into `struct Commands`, [like so](https://github.com/ngpal/glide/commit/f888e60f2b7a86b9cbb797e84f0732b93d5c397c). This looks a whole lot cleaner doesn't it? I'm still conflicted on keeping the `Command` enum itself, because if we're going to `execute` and consume the enum variant as soon as we `parse` the command, where do we need to use this enum? But I have a feeling it might come useful in the future maybe. Let's keep it for now.

After some more [trivial changes](https://github.com/ngpal/glide/commit/66eb502b4d66463cdecea9b17b41f0f75d9ad4e0), like adding command line arguments support for the client, and opening up the connection to the local network in the server, we're ready to move on!
